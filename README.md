## Model Details

- **Model Type**: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **Accuracy**: 79%

The ANN model was trained on a dataset of medical records, and the app allows users to input relevant health metrics to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app from the provided link.
2. Input the required medical data.
3. Get the prediction results and take necessary actions based on the outcome.

## Setup Instructions

If you want to run the app locally:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
